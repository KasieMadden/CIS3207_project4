Signals Sent and Received:
                        One of the first thing I realized was the loss of signals.
                        I believe the losses are contributed to two things. First is when the process is being 
                        terminated there might be signals that are waiting. Second is the time of day I was running 
                        my code on the server. I noicted that the busier the server was, the greater the loss of signals. 
                         

Time: 
    One thing I noticed about the current time was that the printed time didn't always finish exactly at 
    the set time but rather several microseconds before. I've drawn the conclusion that this is because the 
    system time is still running after it loops 10 signals. So it is running for the exact set duration, but the last
    printed time will have been printed before the time is up. 

    I also noticed that every so often the average time printed was -nan instead of a time. This was because 
    there weren't any signals sent since the last received signal causing it to not have an average.
