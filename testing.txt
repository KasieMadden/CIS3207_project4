Testing:

For this program, I used print statements to help debug any issues and understand how the 
processes were being handled. From there, I focused only on signals being sent with the 
current time. I set the sleep function to 5 seconds in the parent process and ran the program.
This provided ample time to see any inconsistencies within my results and showed if there were any memory leaks. 
Once my results were consistent, I moved on to handling time. Keeping the sleep function at 5 second, I 
printed my results and based on the output I made adjustments to my math or addressed any other issues. 
Last, to test a set number of signals, I increased the time in my sleep function within the parent process to 
300 seconds and set the defined number to 100 signals and ran the program. Again, if there were any issues 
I was able to see them and make the appropriate adjustments. 

I decided to perform my testing in this manor because it was easier to see errors and not make the entire 
program overwhelming to handle. Addressing each problem individually is more manageable and follows best practices.
