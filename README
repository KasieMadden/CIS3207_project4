Overview:

The purpose of this program is to introduce signals and demonstrate the use of servicing signals 
sent by other processes. The processes are sent and carried out concurrently, while the execution 
of these processes are tracked and analyzed. 

This proram is tracking signals sent, signals received and the average time in between the signals received. 
In addition, it tracks the current time, total signals sent and total signals received. 

This program holds a parent process, 4 signal processes, 3 signal generators and a reporting process - 
giving the program a total of 9 processes.  

The parent process: 
                The parent process creates 8 children processes, controls the start time and waits for the
                children to finish. 

Signal process:
                The signal process is only handling one SIGUSR at a time and ignoring the other SIGUSR.          

Signal generator:
                The signal generator is executing a random signal that is between SIGUSR1 and SIGUSR2. 

Reporting Process: 
                The reporting process is responding both to SIGUSR1 and SIGUSR2. It handles the time and 
                tracks the number of each occurrences of either SIGUSR1 or SIGUSR2 every 10 signals.
